# Adventure Creator Integration

## Overview

Adventure Creator is a powerful plugin designed to fill existing gaps in narrative, dialogue management, cutscene creation, and interactive storytelling within our project. By integrating Adventure Creator, you can enhance the depth and interactivity of gameplay, allowing for rich story-driven experiences and dynamic in-game events.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Download and Reference the Manual:**  
   Please refer to the official manual available at [https://adventurecreator.org/files/Manual.pdf](https://adventurecreator.org/files/Manual.pdf) for comprehensive setup and configuration instructions.

2. **Plugin Installation:**  
   - Import the Adventure Creator asset package into your Unity project.
   - Verify that the necessary assets and scripts are included in your project’s folder structure.
   - Ensure that the plugin is activated by checking the project settings (see file: `ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset` where `integrationEnabled` is set).

3. **Configuring Project Settings:**  
   - Open the Unity project settings and review the Adventure Creator options.
   - Adjust settings such as dialogue management, cutscene creation, interactive storytelling, and localization as required.
   - Confirm that the manual URL is correctly set to [https://adventurecreator.org/files/Manual.pdf](https://adventurecreator.org/files/Manual.pdf) for quick reference.

## Features and Benefits

- **Dialogue Management:**  
  Easily create and manage branching dialogues. Use the built-in dialogue editor for fine-tuning conversations, character interactions, and narrative flow.

- **Cutscene Creation:**  
  Harness the powerful tools for creating cinematic cutscenes. Seamlessly integrate animations, camera movements, and scripted events to enhance story moments.

- **Interactive Storytelling:**  
  Implement triggers, interactive environmental storytelling, and complex narrative structures that allow for non-linear gameplay.
  
- **Localizability:**  
  Adventure Creator supports localization features, making it easier to adapt dialogue and narrative content for international audiences.

## Integration Guidelines

- **Content Organization:**  
  Maintain separation between core gameplay code and narrative management. Use dedicated scenes and prefabs for Adventure Creator elements.

- **Script Communication:**  
  Use Adventure Creator’s API to trigger dialogue sequences, cutscenes, and interactive events. Ensure your game managers and controllers are set up to interact with the plugin interfaces.

- **UI Integration:**  
  Consider updating UI elements to display dialogue choices and narrative cues. Integrating Adventure Creator with our in-game HUD can provide a seamless player experience.

- **Testing and Debugging:**  
  Regularly test integration scenarios by running through sample dialogue and cutscene sequences. Use logging or in-game debugging tools to verify that the Adventure Creator elements trigger correctly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Assets or Scripts:**  
  Double-check that all necessary assets from the Adventure Creator package are imported. Refer to the manual for a complete list of required components.

- **Configuration Issues:**  
  If you experience unexpected behavior, verify that the project’s settings in `ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset` reflect the proper configuration values (e.g., `manualURL`, dialogue management, and cutscene flags).

- **Performance Considerations:**  
  Make sure to optimize scenes where complex cutscenes or extensive dialogue trees are implemented. Use profiling tools to keep track of any performance impacts after integration.
