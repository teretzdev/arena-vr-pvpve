        [Header("Visual and Audio Effects")]

### Step 4: Review
- **Namespace**: The class is defined within the `ArenaDeathMatch.Abilities` namespace, as required.
- **Properties**: All required properties (`abilityName`, `description`, `manaCost`, `cooldown`) are included. Additional fields (`damage`, `range`, `areaOfEffect`, `visualEffect`, `soundEffect`) are added to align with typical ability data requirements in games.
- **Serialization**: The class is marked as `[System.Serializable]` to ensure it can be used in Unity's inspector.
- **Unity Integration**: The use of `GameObject` and `AudioClip` for visual and audio effects ensures compatibility with Unity's asset system.
- **Code Style**: The code follows C# conventions and includes comments for clarity.
